This open-source python script exploits a zero-day vulnerability on Cyta's newest routers. It allows **full administrative control** (root access) over the target router and its devices. Not only you exploit the router's zero-day vulnerability but you can also initiate a **mitm** (man in the middle) attack through the script and analyze and save your target's data that are being sent and received. The zero-day will soon be reported to Cyta.
